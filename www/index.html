<h2>FAQ</h2>
<h3>1. What is IE Tab +?</h3>
<p>Answer: IE Tab + is a Firefox extension which enables you to use the embedded IE engine within tabs of Mozilla Firefox. It is not only a great tool for web developers, like IE Tab, but also an useful tool for normal users, since you can easily switch to IE in TAB VIEW when you meet incorrectly rendered web pages in Firefox.</p>
<h3>2. Why did you change the name of the addon from Coral IE Tab to IE Tab +?</h3>
<p>Answer: Previously I want the users to remember my brand name "Coral", but now it seems that a more clear name is more valuable for my users. So I decided to change the name to "IE Tab +", which is more clear and easier to remember.</p>
<h3>3. What is the relationship between IE Tab + and IE Tab?</h3>
<p>Answer: IE Tab is a Firefox extension developed by PC Man. I think it's useful, and I want to add more features on it, so I decided to fork a new branch of IE Tab, named it IE Tab +. Many parts are directly taken from IE Tab, so you will find them very similar. However, the core DLL is completely rewritten, to support more advanced features and provide better performance. Besides, I'm continuing adding new features and improvements to the project, so, maybe someday you will find them completely different, from user interface to low level core.</p>
<h3>4. What new features are introduced in IE Tab + compared to IE Tab?</h3>
<p>Answer: Many. The most significant new features may be: supporting Adblock Plus, supporting cookies (so you don't need to relogin when you switch between Firefox and IE), supporting zoom function in IE, etc.</p>
<h3>5. What is the difference between IE Tab + and IE Tab Plus?</h3>
<p>Answer: IE Tab Plus contains a plugin named "Window Shopper" provided by superfish.com. Since a lot of people dislike it, I decided to give them another choice, which does not contain any other plugin, just as clean as the old versions. So I registered another addon on AMO, named "IE Tab +", which represents the clean versions of the IE Tab + project.</p>
<h3>6. Hey, you are the same author who sneaked in the SPYWARE in IE Tab PLUS! Now are you calling this one "IE Tab +" to hide the fact that you used SPYWARE in the same extension with a different name?</h3>
<p>Answer: Yes, I'm the same author of IE Tab Plus and IE Tab +. If I want to hide this fact, I could simply register a new name and upload IE Tab + with the new identity, but I would not do that. I admit that for some financial reasons, I have added the "Window Shopper" module into the IE Tab Plus addon, but I also give the users a choice: if you don't like it, you can simply uninstall the IE Tab Plus addon and install the IE Tab + addon, which is clean. I will not fake to be "clean", everything is transparent. This is an open-source project, every line of the code can be examined.</p>
